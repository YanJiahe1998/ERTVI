# An Open-Source Variational Inference Code for Electrical Resistivity Tomography

**ERTVI** is an open-source code used for quantifying resistivity distributions and associated uncertainties in electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) using variational inference (especially SVGD or sSVGD). The code is modified from the open-source
package **VIP - Variational Inversion Package** developed by Dr. Xin Zhang and Prof. Andrew Curtis from The University of Edinburgh (https://github.com/xin2zhang/VIP). Therefore, the users who use this code should follow the license of VIP. The ERT
simulation code is a modified version of R2 developed by Prof. Andrew Binley. The standard version of R2 can be downloaded at http://www.es.lancs.ac.uk/people/amb/Freeware/R2/R2.htm. 

Synthetic and field experiments are included in the folder “examples”, which can also be used as the template for the code. Note that the field data in Chenqi watershed originated from a project supported by the UK Natural Environment Council (NERC)
Grant NE/N007409/1 awarded to Lancaster University.
